## RUINS
### RUIN 1
~~~
Name: The Parthenon
Date: ~2,500 years
Description: Originally, the Parthenon was built as a shrine honoring the Greek goddess Athena. The Parthenon’s hilltop location meant that it could be seen from all over Athens. The Parthenon has been repurposed as a Byzantine church and, under the Ottomans, a mosque. Earthquakes, fire, gunpowder and looters have all taken their toll.

### RUIN 2
~~~
Name: Stonehenge
Date: ~5,000 years
Description: Building this stone circle would have been a colossal undertaking, yet historians can only guess at why the Neolithic and Bronze Age peoples who built it went to so much trouble. One of the most intriguing aspects of Stonehenge is the Heel Stone. It was once one of a pair of stones (the other since lost) that aligned perfectly to frame the sunrise on the summer solstice. Perhaps, Stonehenge was an ancient solar calendar or simply a place where people came to celebrate the solstices

### RUIN 3
~~~
Name: Temple of Kukulcán
Date: 1050-1300 CE
Description: The name Chichén Itzá means “mouth of the well of the Itza". Architecturally, the pyramid is impressive, with a four-sided, stepped construction whose total number of stairs equals the number of days in the Maya calendar. Interestingly, during the spring and autumn equinoxes, the serpent deity Kukulcán appears to descend as the sun casts a shadow to create a snakelike silhouette on the pyramid’s staircase when viewed with the stonework at the bottom.

### RUIN 4
~~~
Name: Sigiriya 
Date: 477 AD
Description: Sigiriya (Lion Rock) is an ancient fortress that tops a vertiginously steep 650-foot-high rock in Sri Lanka. Its significance is the result of a royal feud. During the fifth century, the ruler Kassapa overthrew and entombed his father. In the process, he usurped the throne from his brother Moggallana, who was the rightful heir. In an attempt to remain king, the unpopular monarch constructed a palace atop the plug of an extinct volcano in the hope that it would be easier to defend. Halfway up this 1,200-step climb, visitors today will pass through a gateway that resembles a lion, hence the site’s name.

### RUIN 5
~~~
Name: Ayutthaya
Date: 1350
Description: Ayutthaya is a ghostly city of striking ruins and entangled wats, or temples, and prang (reliquary towers). It was a trading center, with palaces and monasteries, one of the world’s largest cities in its heyday.

## Ideas
- Think of a backstory behind why a building was created, this influences where it was built, how it was built, what its purpose is
- Old towers, stones, mounds, villages
- How have the elements affected the buildings overtime, are there earthquakes in the area? Is it built near a volcano so does fire affect it?
- Perhaps other groups of people/creatures affected the structures like looters or war
- Earthquake shake that shuffles the cube randomly
