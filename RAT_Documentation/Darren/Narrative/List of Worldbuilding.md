### Inspired IdeasðŸ§ 
- Seperated, fractured ruins that depict various parts of the story/world. Hinting at how the ancient society who wielded this powerful technology died out, what they could accomplish or just who they were and what they stood for.
- The story should not be directly told through exposition, I think we should try to encourage the player to piece together the story for themselves. Hopefully generate intrigue in the story through environmental storytelling, make the players ask themselves things like: "Where did this society come from?", "Who built this place?", "Why does this world rotate?". 
- If each level was a biome, giving narrative hints about what the society did in these biomes and how they adapted to these environments could be a fun idea
- The architecture is important to convey how advanced the civilisation was by contrasting with the present day buildings of the world i.e. simple wooden bridges compared to big, mystical, mechanical pieces.
- Putting an organic environment ontop of the advanced lost civilsations buildings and structures would help communicate the idea that these technologies though advanced are ancient, perhaps hundreds if not thousands of years old
