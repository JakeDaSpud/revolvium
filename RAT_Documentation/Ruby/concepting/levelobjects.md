# Needed Mechanics
- Rotation Panel
    - Locked to block
    - When stood on puts player into rotation view
    - Must be stood on, therefore the platform must be flat down
    - Player only regains controls after a turn completes
    - Player cannot rotate an area that they stand on
- Keys
    - Keys open specific areas, including the end
    - Each key has it's own door
        - A key can only open one specific door
        - A door can only be opened by one specific key
    - Colour or shape coded so it is clear what door it works on
- Doors
    - Lock lock enterable rooms
    - Once unlocked they would be permanently unlocked, unless the level is reset/restarted
    - Must be grounded and correctly orientated to be opened
- Enterable Rooms
    - These would be level blocks with a door and 4 walls with a ceiling and roof
    - There would be a doorway which would need to be orientated the correct way to enter
        - IE: you can't enter an upside-down door
    - Some would have doors, some would just be open
    - One of these could act as the level exit

# Needed Level Blocks
- Flat platform
    - A flat platform that sits at the bottom of it's block, with no changes in elevation. Would be thin.
    - Could be used as a wall, or platform, depending on orientation
- Room
    - A room with entrances
    - Can be locked by doors
    - Would take up a full block space
    - One of these could act as the level exit
- Stairs
    - Would act as a way to bring the player up one level, if orientated correctly
    - Bottom side would act as a flat platform
- Solid Block
    - Takes up full block space, with nothing inside
    - Can act as a platform and wall

# Possible Other Mechanics
- Single Rotation Panel
    - Only rotates in one direction
    - Could change with orientation
-
